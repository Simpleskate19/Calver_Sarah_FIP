# Final Integrated Project

My Website is for gamers to checkout some gaming content.

# Requirements

Use a modern browser (if you don't have one, use Internet Explorer to download something that actually works)

You'll need git installed locally, as well as a preprocessor like SASS for CSS compilation. A good cute editor helps too!

Built with: HTML CSS JavaScript

# Installation, etc

CD to the location of your choice, then git clone, and checkout my website!
